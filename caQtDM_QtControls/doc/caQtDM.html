<h2><b><a name="manual" id="manual" rel="Section">This manual</a></b></h2>
This manual has been written in HTML and after conversion introduced in the Qt assistant in order to get help for the caQtDM system. It has to be noted that caQtDM is though as a replacement of the very known EPICS Display Manager MEDM, therefore this manual is of course also inspired of the existing MEDM manual.
<h2><b><a name="introduction" id="introduction" rel="Section">Introduction</a></b></h2>
caQtDM is a package based on Qt developed at PSI as a successor of MEDM, a well known package used in the EPICS community for building synoptic displays. The caQtDM package uses the standard Qt GUI (Qt designer) for designing synoptic displays, containing all the controls graphical elements necessary to visualize and control a facility. Qt designer uses the custom widgets designed for this purpose and writes a description file (.ui file) that will be used by the synoptic viewer caQtDM. A reload function in caQtDM allows to rapidly see the changes made by the editor in order to accelerate the process of editing and viewing. <br/>
<br/>
The heart of the package are the graphical objects (Widgets) plugged into the Qt designer. These widgets will be described in detail with their properties below. Many objects have been built and more are introduced as soon as they are needed. The Qt system allows in a very easy way to add continuously new objects or to modify these. <br/>
<br/>
Technically the package consists of 3 class libraries with the graphical objects, a class library used by the viewer or other applications and the viewer (caQtDM) itself as well as 3 libraries with the plugin definitions for the Qt designer. The editor (Qt designer) is part of Qt. It has to be noted that the graphical objects are not control system aware. The graphical objects have properties and methods used by the editor. The control system knowledge is then integrated and handled by the viewer. This architecture allowed us to handle easily three control systems: epics, epics4 and an older in house control system. These are all handled by the viewer. This distribution supports per default epics 3. Epics4 can be integrated when building it, but only a few tests could be done while not many process variables could be tested so far. <br/>
<br/>
Part of the package is also a converter (adl2ui) that can convert MEDM .adl files into .ui files used by the caQtDM package. In most cases this converter gives good results. Besides the already mentioned .ui files the viewer can also uses in house developed .prc files. These last files represent asci files to be edited with any text editor using are in house syntax. <br/>
<br/>
The Qt system is widely used today on many platforms and is therefore an ideal system to develop new applications. The advantage of Qt is therefore that an application using this architecture will run on many platforms, so that caQtDM will run on linux as well as on windows systems. <br/>
<h2><b><a name="designer" id="designer" rel="Section">Designer: editor</a></b></h2>
The designer coming with Qt is the editor used for developing the synoptic screens. In this manual we will not describe this editor exhaustively, while the editor has it own manual that can be called by pressing the F1 key. The editor allows by dragging and dropping the graphical objects to be used into the synoptic display. The properties of the graphical objects can then be customized in the property editor. The most important property is normally the device that is monitored or controlled and is represented by the property channel. An exhaustive description of the graphical objects and their properties will be given below.
<h2><b><a name="installation" id="installation" rel="Section">Install</a></b></h2>
Since version 3.1.4 of caQtDM a new build and installation procedure working for several linux platforms are available. <br/>
<br/>
First you will have to unpack the tar archive, which will create the necessary directories and files. In the upper directory you will find the necessary procedures to build the package, run it locally without installing and also an installation procedure.
<ol>
  <li> you will have to install Qt-4.8 and qwt-6 when they are not already installed. On modern systems Qt4 should already be installed, but the qt4-designer not necessarily and you should install it (eventually with sudo apt-get install qt4-designer). qwt is normally not installed and you should install this too. </li>
  <li> you will have to install EPICS </li>
  <li> all the environment variables used for the installation will be defined in the script caQtDM_Env. When some of the variables are already defined in your environment, the script will use them, otherwise they will be defined. It is up to you to edit this file and adapt the variables to your environment. </li>
  <li> the script caQtDM_BuildAll will build you the package now into the directory ./caQtDM_Binaries. You should obtain there adl2ui, caQtDM, libqtcontrols.so and libcaQtDM_Lib.so as well as a designer directory containing 3 files libqtcontrols*_plugin.so. if you encounter a problem when building due to some environment variable problem or while not everything was installed before, you may correct your problem and run the script again. In case you want to cleanup you use the script caQtDM_CleanAll, which will also delete the resulting binaries. </li>
  <li> you may try to install the package: the package should normally be installed in the EPICS extensions and the environment variables are pointing to them. </li>
  <li> running caQtDM: when the package has been successfully build into the directory ./caQtDM_Binaries, you can start caQtDM by using the script startDM_Local and the qt4-designer by the script qtdesigner (all located in the main directory where you expanded the tar file). These scripts will set some important environment variables in order to set the path, the plugin_path and to point to the test directory provided with the package (./caQtDM_Tests). In this directory also the stylesheets are located to be used for a nice rendering. You may call the test.ui file with the above mentioned scripts. In order to test the display some EPICS channels have to be defined. This can be done by running a soft-ioc shell called with run-epics also provided in the test directory. </li>
  <li> in case you have qwt 6.1 you will have to use in caQtDM_QtControls/src the files qwt_thermo_marker_61.* instead of qwt_thermo_marker.* </li>
  <li> in case you already use Qt5.1 with qwt6.1 the building should also be straight forward. </li>
  <li> Instructions for compiling caQtDM on Windows
    
    Requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>Qt 4.8.2</li>
      <li>Qwt 6.0.1</li>
      <li>EPICS 3.12.2</li>
      <li>MS Visual Studio 2010</li>
      <li>Wix 3.0.5419.0</li>
    </ul>
    With caQtDM_Env.bat you can configure your system. All settings which are needed will be taken from here.<br/>
    The building can be started with the batchfile : caQtDM_BuildAll.bat<br/>
    The packaging is made with the batch file : caQtDM_Build_Package.bat<br/>
    This will generate a MSI installation file in the folder of caQtDM_Binaries.<br/>
    To clean the Folder you should use caQtDM_CleanAll.bat.<br/>
  </li>
</ol>

  <li>When you do not want a window to be resized, you can specify -noResize on the command line.</li>
  <li>Another enhancement existing since version 2.8 is the fact that you can hook a digit of the wheelswitch to the keyboard in order to modify it with the up and down keys.</li>
</ul>
<div> <font color="#0000ff">2.8 </font> </div>
<ul>
  <li>All the changes have been documented in qtdefs.pri</li>
</ul>
<div> <font color="#0000ff">2.5</font> </div>
<ul>
  <li>Scales of Stripplot can now be changed during runtime. The caQtDM application normally limits the update rate of monitors to 5 Hz,</li>
  <li>however now a JSON string can be written behind the channel name.</li>
  <li>An example is given in the presentation <a href="caQtDM_introduction.ppt">&quot;introduction to caQtDM&quot;</a>.</li>
  <li>Color mode for calabel is now working (was forgotten). Also an icon is presented on the window bars.</li>
  <li>A Windows distribution package allowing to work immediately with the designer and caQtDM has been build and can be downloaded here</li>
  <li>(this package does not contain any sources, merely executables, work done by H.Brands at PSI). </li>
</ul>
<div> <font color="#0000ff">2.3</font> </div>
<ul>
  <li>Timebase of Stripplot was wrong and has been corrected. Some other compiler warnings have been eliminated and the building process was slightly modified.</li>
</ul>
<div> <font color="#0000ff">2.1</font> </div>
<ul>
  <li>When using correctly the layout possibilities offered by Qt, one can resize a window (you will find an example in work/caQtDM/parser/proscanFiles/phaseslitsnew.ui).</li>
  <li>Up to now when using &quot;includes&quot; only a placeholder could be seen in the designer. Now the included ui file is displayed inside the designer.</li>
  <li>For polylines and polygones, a graphical editor is integrated into the designer. One can create segments by pressing the left mouse button when moving the</li>
  <li> mouse and one can delete the last created segment by pressing the right mouse button.</li>
  <li>The graphical entities (rectangles, circles, ellipses, lines, arrows, triangles) can be  rotated by specifying a tilt angle.</li>
</ul>
<div> <font color="#0000ff">2.0</font> </div>
<ul>
  <li>The major changes in this version are changes for stability (in the previous version sometimes crashes occurred) and the introduction</li>
  <li>of soft pv's. A variable can be defined, calculated and used as a normal pv.</li>
  <li>All the features of medm used for the cartesian plots are implemented now. The caCartesian plot background can be transparent so that a camera image can be</li>
  <li>underlaid. The limits of the x and y axes can be changed by specifiying pv's instead of values when using channel limits. The stripplot widget has been</li>
  <li>modified while the behaviour was not quite correct. The message button and textentry were not working well and have been corrected. Labels can be transparent too.</li>
  <li>A camera widget has been introduced. At PSI we can now display are usual cameras bw and color. You can easily modify the code to treat other formats</li>
  <li>of camera waveforms.</li>
  <li>caQtDM gives the number of connected and unconnected channels, furthermore a list of unconnected channels with their file location can be shown.</li>
  <li>caQtDM is now protected against ui description file syntax errors;</li>
  <li>caQtDM supports the command line parameters -attach -noMsg -display -macro -x -noStyles -dg. -x has no effect but suppresses the error message when</li>
  <li>keeping the medm command line parameters.</li>
  <li>caQtDM runs in native mode on linux as well as on microsoft windows.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b><a name="widgets" id="widgets" rel="Section">caQtDM Custom Widgets</a></b></h2>
The custom widgets used in caQtDM have been divide in three categories as was done in MEDM. MEDM users are used to these cartegories and we have therefore kept the categorisation in Graphics, Controller and Monitors. As in MEDM, Graphics are items such as frames, labels, graphical entities like rectangles, triangles, lines, ..., images and composite objects (called here includes, while included from other ui files. Monitors are objects that monitor the state or values of process variables through display of values, plots, tables, thermometers, dials, ... Controllers are objects that change the values of process variables through many different objects. you will find here an exact description of them with their properties: For all objects, you have normally their geometry (position and size),, sizepolicy and some other properties like tooltips. It has to be noted that for many widgets their stylesheet will be overwritten in order to get the representation that is requested when specifying for example background, foreground, border colors or other properties. The stylesheet can be influenced in some cases by specifying a stylesheet for the mainwindow or in stylesheet.qss, a stylesheet found in the caQtDM path. The adl2ui converter uses normally this stylesheet to integrate these defaults into the generated ui file. You may delete this stylesheet or change it to your convenience. However as mentioned before, many styles will be overwritten. <br/>

The following table gives you an overview of all objects that are actually available: <br/>

in caQtDM curve can be zoomed with the mouse by pressing the left mouse button and selecting the area that has to be zoomed. The area is shown by a rubberband rectangle. Reset zoom can be chosen through the context menu. Translation can be done by pressing the middle mouse button and moving the mouse.
  Pressing the right mouse button will bring up a context menu (for pvInfo, resetting zoom and changing axes)<br />
  <br />
A caQtDM Cartesian Plot has the same conventions as a MEDM Cartesian Plot. This plot is a very important tool used in control systems and its behaviour was taken from MEDM. The Cartesian consists of an X and one or two Y axes on which data can be plotted. The sets of data are called traces and consist of a set of (x, y) pairswith the properties shown above. The traces correspond to curves on the plot. Currently there can be up to six traces on a plot. Each trace can (but does not have to) have a process variable from which to get the x values and another from which to get the y values. These process variables can be array process variables, such as Waveforms, or they can be scalar process variables with only a single value. The variables have to be separated by a semicolumn (see above).<br />
<br />
There are eight possible kinds of traces as seen in the following table. The traces for a given plot do not all have to be of the same kind – they can be mixed. (In the table Nx is the number of elements in the process variable specified for x, and Ny is the number of elements in the process variable specified for y. The letter n denotes a number greater than one, and a blank indicates no process variable is specified. The axis limits LOPR and HOPR denote the limits obtained from Channel Access for the process variable. Typically, these are the fields LOPR and HOPR in the associated record, but can be specified by the user with the properties XaxisScaling and YaxisScaling. Count is the specified Count for the Cartesian Plot, which is described in more detail below.)<br />

<br/>
If one of the process variables is an array with more than one element and if Count is a number greater than zero, then the specified Count is ignored and the value shown in the last column of the table is used. Under the same circumstances, if Count is a name, then it is used only if it is greater than 0 and less than what would be used if it were a number. That is, Count from a process variable can only restrict NPoints to a lower number than it would be otherwise. The points are plotted from i = 0 to NPoints - 1 and update as the values change. In the cases where one of the process variables is not specified, the history is plotted on that axis against values from 0 to NPoints – 1 on the other axis. <br />
<br />
If one of the process variables is an array with more than one element and the CA server of the process variable supports dynamic arrays, then when a zero is specified for Count, the number of array elements will be set to the current number of valid elements in the array which may vary with subsequent array update events. <br />
<br />
In the remaining cases, where neither process variable is an array with more than one element, Count corresponds to a history of the process variable. (These are the cases where NPoints is shown as Count in the table.) Each time the process variable changes (or when either one changes, in the case of X, Y Scalar) a new point is plotted until there are Count points. The points are plotted from i = 0 to the lesser of Count -1 and the number of updates. When the Plot Mode is “plot n pts &amp; stop,” no more points are plotted. When the Plot Mode is “plot last n pts,” the earliest point is discarded, the others are moved down, and the latest is plotted at the end. In the cases where one of the process variables is not specified, the history is plotted on that axis against values from 0 to Count – 1 on the other axis. <br />
<br />
The above behaviour still has to be tested thoroughly. It appeared already that perhaps Count must be twice the value described above ?

  Qt supports many graphics format, try yours to see if it will be displayed. The most interesting format is however the animated GIF format. These GIF image files may include multiple frames, transparency, and most other features supported by the GIF format. If the GIF image file has multiple frames, caQtDM can choose to animate the images or to display a specified frame. The default is to animate if there is more than one frame. To display a specific frame, enter an
  expression for the Image Calc that returns a frame number. Frame numbers start with 0. The <a href="#CalcExpression">syntax</a> for the Image Calc expression is the same as that for the Visibilty property, and it uses channels A-D in the Dynamic Attribute. The only difference is that the CALC expression should return a frame number, not True or False. The value will be rounded to the nearest integer. Frame numbers that are too high will use the last frame, and frame numbers that are too small will use the first frame. The Image will be black in EXECUTE mode if the Image Calc expression is invalid. The visibility of the Image is determined in the usual way if there is a channel specified. A multiple-frame Image even with no  process variables specified for the Dynamic Attribute does update with some speed. Use the Image Calc expression and the process variables in the Dynamic
  Attribute to specify when to display each color. 
  There is an <a href="#EPICSExtension">EPICS extension</a>called <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/extensions/index.php">Simple GIF Animator (SGA)</a> that allows you to create and modify animated GIFs for use in caQTDM. There are also many other GIF animators available, especially for Microsoft Windows. It does not make any difference which platform you use to create or manipulate the images. You cannot use SGA or most of the animators to create the images themselves, only to add, delete, and rearrange
  them plus modify some of the GIF parameters. There are many drawing and image editing programs that allow you to create and edit images. For UNIX, the <a
href="http://www.gimp.org/">GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)</a>is a good choice and is free. </blockquote>

<h2><b><a href="commandline" name="commandline" id="commandline" rel="Section">Command Line Options</a></b></h2>
caQtDM can be executed with the same options as MEDM; this to be compatible with its options.

the following options are supported:<br/>
<br/>
[-help
| -h | -&#8204;], <em>gives a description of the options</em><br/>
[-x], <em>has no effect</em> <br/>
[-attach], <em>will attach to a running caQtDM</em> <br/>
[-noMsg], <em>will iconize the main window</em> <br/>
[-noStyles], <em>no stylesheet will be loaded, works only when not attaching</em> <br/>
[-print], <em>will print file and exit</em> <br/>
[-noResize], <em>will prevent resizing, works only when not attaching</em> <br/>
[-macro
&quot;<i >xxx</i>=<i
>aaa</i>,<i >yyy</i>=<i >bbb</i>, ...&quot;], <em>will apply macro substitution to replace occurrences of $(xxx<i
>) with </i>value aaa<i>.</i></em> <br/>
[-dg
[<i >xpos</i>[x<i >ypos</i>]][+<i >xoffset</i>[+<i >yoffset</i>s]], <em>specifies the geometry (location and size) of the synoptic display</em>. <br/>
<br/>
Parameters
in square brackets [] are optional.
<h3 >Examples:</h3>
Start up, performing macro substitution of all occurrences of &#036;(a) and &#036;(c) in the display file, xyz.ui: <br/>
<strong>caQtDM -macro &quot;a=b,c=d&quot; xyz.adl &amp;</strong><br/>
Start
up in execute mode; resize the display window corresponding to abc.adl to 100 by 100 pixels and move it to the location, x
= 100 and y = 100; and move the display window corresponding to def.adl to x = 400 and y = 150: <br/>
<strong>caQtDM –dg 100x100+100+100 abc.ui&amp;</strong>
<h2><b><a href="files" name="files" id="files" rel="Section">Description Files</a></b></h2>
With the Qt designer you produce xml files with the extension .ui. These files are used as input for the synoptic viewer caQtDM. These xml ascii file can be edited by hand, but care has to be taken while caQtDM and Qt designer do not forgive any error. Qt designer will however tell you at what line the mistake is produced. <br/>
The files are normally loaded from the current directory and/or from the directory specified by the environment variable CAQTDM_DISPLAY_PATH. The directories are specified with the separator : for linux and ; for microsoft windows.
<h2><b><a href="connection" name="connection" id="connection" rel="Section">Connection Problems and Access Rights</a></b></h2>
When caQtDM cannot connect the specified process variable normally white colors will be drawn. A list of unconnected process variables can be called through the menu of the main window of caQtDM. When a process variable is not writeable the cursor will change to some special sign.
<h2><b><a href="fonts" name="fonts" id="fonts" rel="Section">Fonts</a></b></h2>
The custom widgets make extensively use of the Qt font<em> &quot;Lucida Sans Typewriter&quot;</em>. If this font does not exist in some cases it will fall back to a font called &quot;Monospace&quot;. However the &quot;Lucida&quot; font is really the appropriated font to display numbers and it is warmly advised to have this font installed. <br/>

  <div> For the <a href="#TextEntry">Text Entry</a> and <a href="#TextIndicator">Text Monitor</a> . For all of the formats, the result depends on the number itself and the
    precision as returned from channel access for the process variable. The precision is typically the PREC
    field for the associated record. The PREC field is only determined when
    the process variable is connected, so subsequent changes to the PREC do not
    affect the format until the synoptic display is reloaded.</div>
  <h3><a name="calcexpressions" id="calcexpressions" rel="Section">CALC Expressions</a></h3>
  <div> CALC expressions are used to determine visibility for graphical objects and to determine the frame number for the <a href="#caImage">caImage</a> , which also has a Dynamic Attribute. For visibility the expression should return 0 for False and anything else for True. For the frame number for the Image it
    should return a number, which will be rounded to the nearest integer. Frame numbers start with 0. CALC expression are also used for calculations in the caCalc widget in order to calculate internally an internal variable. The usual method (the simplest one) is to use the CALC expression as described in detail in the Record Reference Manual found under IOC software for any version of EPICS base, through at least Base 3.13. It is a case-independent C expression
    that can include functions such as ABS, SQR, MIN, MAX, CEIL, FLOOR, LOG, LOGE,
    EXP, SIN, SINH, ASIN, COS, COSH, ACOS, TAN, TANH, and ATAN, as well as the usual C operators, except that != is replaced by # and == is replaced by
    =. The letters A-L obtain their
    values from the Channels A-D and are replaced as follows.<br />

    Show the object whenever the value of Channel A is 12: A=12<br />
    Show the object whenever the value of Channel A is not 12: A#12<br />
    Show the object whenever the values of Channel A, Channel B, and Channel C are all negative: A&lt;0&amp;&amp;B&lt;0&amp;&amp;C&lt;0<br />
    Show the object whenever the main process variable is within 90% of its HOPR or LOPR limits: A&lt;.9*L||A&gt;.9*H<br />
    Show the object whenever the SEVERITY of the main process variable is not 0: !J <br/><br/>

    It is also possible to use a regular expression as CALC string. The regular expression should start with %/ and finish with / and should return true or false. The regular expression uses only the channel A. An example would be %/^$|\\s+/. This expression gives true or false when the string given by channel A is empty or not.<br/><br/>

    As from version 3.9.4 a Python function can also be used and has to be introduced into the CALC field the following way:<br/><br/>
%P/def PythonCalc(a, b, c, d):<br/>
	return (a*b)<br/>
/<br/><br/>

    The function name is fixed (PythonCalc) and must have 4 variables in its parameter list (not doing so the function will be disabled). The string has to start with %P/ and finish with /. Be aware of the fact that tabs have to be used in Python. The values will be taken from from the 4 channels if present and the function will have to return a real value.<br/><br/>

<h3><a name="macrosubstitution" id="macrosubstitution">Macro Substitution</a></h3>
Strings of the form $(name) in an ADL file can be replaced by some other string, both on the command line and when calling a <a href="#RelatedDisplay">related display</a>. Specific directions for each of these cases are given in the correspoonding sections of the manual.
In general, there is an argument string of the form &#8220;name1=value1[,name2=value2]&#8230;&#8221;. All
occurrences of &#8220;$(name1)&#8221; in the ADL file are replaced with &#8220;value1&#8221;, then all occurences of $(name2)
are replaced by value2, <i>etc</i>. The substitition is recursive; that is, if value1 contains an occurrence of $(name2), then when
name2=value2 is processed, that occurrence will be replaced by value2.<br />
