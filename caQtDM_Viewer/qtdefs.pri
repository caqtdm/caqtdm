# added for the cartesianplot resize of the fatdots plot
# softpv treatment was slowing done caQtDM and is corrected now
# camera has been more optimized for 16bit waveforms (the other types not yet, due to a lack of waveforms types)
# label and vertical label can gave a border now
# caChoice has now the possibility to display a row from the bottom to the top (rowInverse) and is optimized
# soft pv's without a name were not working, now automatically a name is generated
# in order to have cacalc's working correctly in includes, a macro can be used in order to individialize them
# zero values in cartesian plot are now replaced by the lowest non-zero value when logarithmic scale is used
# for infinite values, cartseian plot was taken unlimited resources for display, this should be corrected nw
# slots are added to cagraphics for animation of these objects (tilt angle, span angle, arc, .. can be set now through signals
# caCamera will now zoom by default on the middle of the image and otherwise around the last clicked point
# autorepeat on canumeric has been take out on request of the users

# .ftvl field of epics is now used to distingues signed anand unsigned display in cawavetable
# in pep file you may add now the keyword -minwidth to an item in order to define the minimum width of it (default value=100).
#      you can steer column width like that. also -comsize has been added for the comment to steer the fontsize.
# cachoice has been slightly modified in order to grow instead of shrink (for pep files this was an issue)
# searching of a pv for the infobox would find the pv independently of the associated plugin, giving therefore confusion

# 4.1.2
# caLineDemo has been renamed in caLineDraw and is now able to draw vertically
# cawavetable takes now information from channel.FTVL into account in order to define signed or unsigned data
# added CTRL+C to camultinestring for copying to clipboard

# caslider and cathermo can now display also a value; caslider got also the possibility to set distinctly the lower and upper limit (Josh Dassigner from Argonne)
# caQtDM will now display mu and grad on all platforms
# adapted cathermo and caslider so that it can take ito account a default style with fore and background colors; now Alarm is modified in Alarm_Default or Alarm_static
# now a widget can be added (see caLineDemo) without having to change caQtDM_lib. An interface has been defined in order to perform the datacuisition inside the widget class.
# caLineDemo widget is an example for a fast on QWidget based line monitor
# caMimeDisplay will now take macros into account
# fatDots implemented in cartesian plot
# more optimized image display
# tab order and focus considered
# trailing zeros of caspinbox and cawheelswitch suppressed
# toggle button for a soft pv was not working
# caQtDM uses now qwt6.1.1 in order to take advantage of multicore processing

# 4.0.3
# it is now possible to pipe ui data to caQtDM
# reload management had to be changed due to some Qt memory management problem
# eliminated some memory leaks
# corrected wavetable string crash
# one can now define if the size of an included ui file will be size adjusted or not
# cabyte, cabytecontroller performance were bad and has to be be corrected
# camenu and catogglebutton color handling is now done by stylesheet and not with palette colors. This in order to prevent cascading stylesheets, that have precedence over palette colors, to interfere.
# default property for label set to transparent color
# window for included filenames shows now the number of times and average loadtime for loading.

# 4.0.2
# caQtDM can now be told to load a specific stylesheet file by the option -stylefile filename
# option -noResize has been implemented now
# capolyline initialisation was missing for proper resize
# new options on command line available for caQtDM: -cs for specifiying default plugin to be used, -options for passing options (key, value pairs) to plugins
# use now the QStringlList editor in Designer for semicolumn separated strings
# mobile handling of config files slightly modified
# adjustment of fonts for android modified / apply button of caapplynumeric is now resizable
# resizing was perturbed by a resize forced by incoming channel data.
# the vertical label has now an alignment property
# cacartesianplot was not always well triggered when a trigger channel was specified, now corrected
# camimebutton added in order to start applications defined through the file extension
# cawavetable can now adapt its rows and columns automatically when zero is specified.
# an enum can be display in calineedit as number when enumeric is specified as format (otherwise as string in all cases)
# a multistring widget has been added to display waveforms with chars and strings (in case of chars a \n will make a new line)
# initialisation of the first stripplot values with nan instead of zero. Value zero was confusing.
# added the possibility to clear the messages through the file menu
# in case of -attach with a huge macro, the shared memory was designed too small. now 2 kBytes can be transferred
# camultilinestring has been implemented in order to mainly display char waveforms where carriage returns (ascii code 13) will produce a new line
# cameter was not updating its label for Qt5; this has been corrected
# some possible buffer overrun conditions corrected
# one can choose now the number of divisions for x on castripplot
# tooltip for properties are now present in psi patched version of Qt4.8.2 and for Qt5.6.0 and higher
# tooltip for caQtDM objects will integrate the tooltip given by the designer
# signal emit of cacalc has now also its integer and double value (this way you can for example switch the tabwidget pages with a cacalc that is updated by a soft/real channel)
# pep emulation has been updated by cosylab
# some slots have been added in order to link signals and slots in designer
# QStackedWidget will also optimize its io for visible/hidden tabs
